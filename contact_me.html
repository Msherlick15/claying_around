I am a freshman in high school and I make pottery at Thomas Jefferson art studio. I have four years of experience making ceramics. My price range will be from $15 to $40 (but it may depend on the pot). On all the bottoms of my pots will have my name on it and a star. It takes up to a month to make these products because I only go twice a week. Bellow are some videos on how I make my pots. They are buttons so when you click on them it will take you to the video.
