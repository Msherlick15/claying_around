<h2>
  In this video I am making the pot. I will start by slapping it down on the wheel, then I will wet it. After that I will do a process called centering. I am using the wooden tool and the sponge during this process. Once it is centered I am opening up a hole in the middle and shaping it. At this point you can make almost anything. I will be making a bowl. When I am done I will use the wire tool to cut it off the wheel. Then the next step is waiting until it is leather dry and trimming it.

<h2>
  In this video I am trimming the pot. In this case I will be trimming a bowl. First I will make sure it is centered on the wheel, I will do this by using my finger to see that it goes all the way around. After that i will put small pieces of clay to attach it to the wheel. Then I will take my big trimming tool and cut off a layer of the pot. In pottery you want to trim a pot to get rid of the excess weight and to make it look nice. You can do a foot too but I just do a simple flat bottom. Then  will write my name on it and put a star (my class symbol)

<h2>
In this video I am waxing my pieces you wax the bottoms of the pieces so that they don't stick to the kiln. I am taking my wax and brush and spreading an even layer on the bottom of each pot. Then I will start my glazing process.

<h2>
  In this video I am glazing. First I will find my glazes. After that I will mix them until they do not have any clumps. Then I take my piece and dip it in the first color and wipe off the bottom with my sponge. Then I dip it in my second glaze and wipe it off again. (This can vary based on the technique so sometimes I will only one coat of glaze or do drips.) Check out the gallery for finished products.
